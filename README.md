### Front-end test ###

In the front-end folder there is a screenshot named "front-end-design.png". This is an actual screenshot from a feature in Winningtemp. 

#### Task 1 ####
Re-implement this design with your own HTML and CSS.

**Requirements:**

 - The design should look as similar as possible to the screenshot
 - The design should be responsive, meaning it should look good on small devices as well as desktop devices
 - The values in the matrix are decimals with one decimal point from 0.0 to 10.0. A question mark is used when a value is missing (no value).
	 - The background colors in the matrix are based on the value:
		 - Value less than 2.0: #ff1f40
		 - Value between 2.0 and 4.0: #fc9526
		 - Value between 4.0 and 6.0: #f6d827
		 - Value between 6.0 and 8.0: #c9e223
		 - Value greater than 8.0: #97e126
		 - No value: #cccccc

#### Task 2 ####
Implement your design in javascript using whatever framework you like (React, Angular, vue.js, jquery, plain javascript). 

**Requirements:**

- The javascript code should be able to render the design with a dynamic set of rows and columns based on some kind of data structure
- Extra points for providing unit tests with your code
